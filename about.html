		<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
		<p style="font-size:16px">
			My works are detailed ink drawings that explore creatures and natural forms synergising and adapting to manmade interventions in dystopic environments.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:16px">
			The study of creature behaviour is inspired by mythological, historical and faerie elements. Along with these I draw an imagined future by connecting all the epochs bygone and currently unfurling. Sentient beings and natural elements are constant witnesses to changes in our biodiversity and terrain. I believe in honouring them by drawing them in diverse environments with repetitive patterns weaving them into transformative shifts.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:16px">
			The phenomenon of Transverse orientation, where all living organisms are drawn to light created a curiosity in me to study creature behaviour. Wherein consciously and unconsciously sentient beings are drawn to light, like a moth to flame. To this there is a parallel drawn of natural resources disappearing because of manmade intervention in the name of progress. My art practice reflects these aspects of co-existence and depletion through the dreamscapes I create.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:16px">
			I experiment with various materials – ink, handmande papers, textiles, adhesives, found objects magnifying glass, tools used for examining and observing. The act of looking and engaging with a natural element through a magnifying glass almost encases the aspect of an element being caught inside a memory. which I create through mixed mediums onto diverse surfaces.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:16px">
			Along with my own art practice, I also dabble in various other art related pursuits like art therapy and art restoration.
